## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned how to align the images to the bottom right of the div container.

```css
.card img {
  display: block;
  margin-left: auto;
}
```

How to use my macs built in image preview to determine pixel sizing for the design files.

### Continued development

Focusing on using rem instead of pixels. Only using pixels for font and border radii.

### Useful resources

- [Mr Coder Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxwsEZxa1AI&ab_channel=MrCoder) - This helped me with with finalizing my HTML markup. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward when I need to stagger cards within a div.

- [Florin Pop Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcSUEo0P0GU) - This showed me a different way to approach the project. I didn't follow the same path, but it provides another way of doing the project.

- [Pixel to Rem Converter](https://www.ninjaunits.com/converters/pixels/pixels-rem/) - This is a helpful tool that allows me to convert pixels to rem.
